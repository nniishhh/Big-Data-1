Come build the next generation of robotics software with us!
We are looking for candidates with a background in robotics, RT/embedded development or RPC communication. Most development will be in C++. Experience with ROS or DDS is desired.
Message me for details!


R&D Engineer in robotics, I am a C++ expert (among the 4% top most active coder as of June 2013 on GitHub.com[1]) and particularly interested by humanoid robotics. I have extensive experience on robot control, motion planning and vision for humanoid robots.

I have been working in different high-tech start-up (Gostai, now part of Aldebaran Robotics) and research laboratories (iLab at USC, LRDE at EPITA) around the world (France, USA, Japan). These past experiences gave me a strong background in both research and engineering.

I am dedicated to enhancing robotics community better software and as part of this effort I am a Debian contributor and maintain a couple of robotics software packages on various platforms. I am also a ROS expert (the most popular open-source robotics development platform) and contributor.

I have been given the opportunity to think of robotics software problem from the research idea up to delivering an ""industry grade"" implementation.

I also led during 5 years a non-profit organization aiming at providing support and information for non-professional video game development (a.k.a. ""Indie Games"").

Strong engineering skills in C++, Python, Linux and various open source tools.
Applied mathematics and physics.

My name is Danh Vuong and I am a full-stack web developer living in Seattle, WA. I have a broad experience with various development technologies, and I am currently specializing in JavaScript and React.
Coding and solving complex algorithm problems has been my passion since the day I started my Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly, Seattle. I love building web experiences that are effortless for users, and enjoy solving design problems through code.

Aside from coding, I am also a pianist and a conductor for my church choir. Having chance to work with various teams and people refined my empathy, strategy and problems solving. I translate those valuable skills to my work environment, which allows me to offer unique and creative approaches to any project or challenge.
