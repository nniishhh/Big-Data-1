An experienced project manager, here are three key career accomplishments:

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Co-wrote Facebookï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s global operational policy for spam, impacting 20,000 content reviewers.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Collaborated with 30+ stakeholders while leading and executing on projects. This included product, civic, legal, operations, risk, engineering and data teams.

As a first-generation Asian American, I've seen the struggles my parents went through to give a better life to my sister, brother, and me. They raised me up to never be afraid of hard work and be laser-focused on my dreams and goals. Oh boy, do I have many. Some of them are  

1. Giving my parents the lifestyle they thought can't become a reality
2. Empowering others with the mindset and resources to achieve dreams 
3. Creating a global impact in causes I care about (Breast Cancer Research, Women in Tech, etc.)

I knew those can't be realized through just working a job my whole life, so I chose to build and scale businesses under the guidance of successful entrepreneurs on the side.

Looking forward to connecting with other like-minded individuals! Happy to see if I could be of help.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheyennelogan/,,"I am an award-winning, seasoned Project Manager/Producer with experience leading high-functioning, multi-disciplinary teams through complex projects. I have never encountered a project I could not manage. I am inspired by results and outcomes that exceed expectations; I pride myself on achieving the impossible. I enjoy partnering with teams to make ideas come to life. With deep experience across a wide range of industries, I have the prowess to contribute to the overarching visions and manage the tasks necessary to execute said vision. I am adept at working with various stakeholders across product, technology, marketing, sales, and legal. I possess the ability to think strategically and be flexible to accommodate urgency and business needs.

Outside of Work: 
When Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not managing projects, you can find me exploring local terrain and expanding my palate. I geek out over traveling to foreign countries and connecting with people from different backgrounds. I love all things creative and recently took upior design as a hobby. I spend too much time talking about the importance of self-care and good mental health. Meditation relaxes me and jazz music soothes my soul. Michelle Obama is my hero; she constantly inspires me to be better, do better, and always take the high road.

During my time at Google, I've had the great opportunity to work in our two core businesses: Search & Search Ads. Within these groups, I've been even more fortunate to lead projects that are top-level organizational priorities due to their impact and scale, providing unique opportunities to learn and grow in highly visible and cross-functional environments.

In Search Ads, I led the effort to optimize and evolve the user interface of Google Search on mobile. As the lead PM, I provided strategic direction to a team of 20+ engineers, designers, quantitative analysts, and researchers to brainstorm, experiment, and launch whole-page redesigns that improved the user experience of Search while also driving value to advertisers. These efforts drove multi-billion dollar impact to Google revenue and were launched toï¿½ï¿½all mobile users of Search, affecting hundreds of millions of people per day.ï¿½ï¿½

Today, I'm a product manager complete, the product that helps users complete their queries to Search across all platforms (mobile web, desktop, and the Google Search apps). Since this product sits at the very top of the funnel, improvements our team makes have the potential to significantly impact top-level Search metrics and usership, once again making this area a top-level strategic priority for Google.

The name is also claimed to be reminiscent of the Library of Alexandria.

Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant developed by Amazon, made popular by the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Echo Dot devices developed by Amazon Lab126. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audio books, and providing weather, traffic, and other real time information, such as news.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/elidaruiz/,,"I am an intrinsically passionate self-driven professional with the ability to achieve goals individually and with a team. I have worked in Finance, Operations, IT, Analytics, and Strategy departments within the Banking and Tech industries. However, regardless of the subject matter expertise ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  which has become blurrier with time in such dynamic professional world ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I use clear communication and character authenticity as keys to any accomplishments. 

Being good at oneï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s job is being responsible to deeply understand responsibilities, context, and scope. Next, deep subject matter knowledge without losing sight of stakeholdersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ priorities is key to effective stakeholder management. Finally, timely communication ensures success. I keep work direct and friendly. I am a firm believer that these two should not be mutually exclusive.

Early in my career, I rotated within the Finance, Analytics, and Operations departments in Banking where I created financial models, developed predictingd assorted statistical software, and managed a process improvement team accordingly. Once I gained more experience in different areas of the business, I headed the expansion of a fund to Spain and oversaw the European Investments in Spain designing and implementing a new revenue stream. 

Subsequently, I directed the Financial work stream and co-lead the Strategy work stream by coordinating resources in Treasury and Finance departments to perform the liquidity and capital analysis needed to author the Resolution Plan submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 
After finishing my MBA, I transitioned to the Tech industry. Since then I have worked in a worldwide renown company where I set the benchmark productivity in Emerging Markets: India, Brazil, Middle East, Mexico, and Australia. The worldwide operations benchmarking program involves setting performance expectations for 200+ operations center worldwide, which made up a cost bucket of over a billion.    

Not to sound clichï¿½ï¿½ [clichï¿½ï¿½ coming], my intrinsically driven nature comes from a deep yearning to always learn and level the ground for more people regardless of uncontrollable variables such as resources. Having lived, studied, or traveled to 30+ countries from a young and impressionable age, I realized that professional success is more often correlated to opportunity than talent. I truthfully maximize every opportunity I have and want to create those opportunities for",Manager | Strategy | Part of the Solution | Amazon,Greater Seattle Area,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGUjxyJFlLUwA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1564165230328?e=1625097600&v=beta&t=l-479CwFGE5KR6vizWTiSaEOqc-MonzHrgsoTxT-1ek,Elida,"Ruiz, MBA, PMP","Elida Ruiz, MBA, PMP",1431,-1,ACoAAAMEyIABrfWpNEhSGVRIPHAAVOaJmr2RbZ4,50645120,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAMEyIABrfWpNEhSGVRIPHAAVOaJmr2RbZ4,name",500,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAMEyIABrfWpNEhSGVRIPHAAVOaJmr2RbZ4%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAMEyIABrfWpNEhSGVRIPHAAVOaJmr2RbZ4%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,Amazon,https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon/,"Manager, Project Engineers OpsTech IT NA",,"Seattle, Washington, United States",Apr 2020 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ P,Amazon,https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon/,"Sr. Program Manager, Amazon Customer Excellence System","- Responsible for implementation of Benchmark Analytics and Program in Emerging Markets: India, Brazil, Middle East, Mexico, and Australia.

For twenty years, I worked in health care as a massage therapist and hypnotist that helped hundreds of people heal, created networks of professionals to speed referrals for patients, and published a book about my career.  Since 2006, I have worked on projects in technology doing project management, process engineering, sales enablement, business intelligence, and VIP customer service.  During this time, four of my Microsoft clients won awards for work to which I contributed.  

I am passionate about being a solution creator.  My work has given me experience in developing, evaluating, and facilitating global programs.  I routinely automate my job in my relentless search for quality. Using my skills in human behavior and ethics, I create business intelligence dashboards that change group dynamics and challenge them to perform. I also create ethics-based program management games from Microsoft tools.

I am passionate about my personal brand. People who have experienced my work have kindly left me their recommendations on my LinkedIn profile. I am proudly well-known as a fast, reliable, ethical, and efficient person that does everything possible to never waste another person's time. You will find me a calming, outgoing, and articulate communicator with the ability to work well with colleagues and business partners at all levels of the organization.",Author | Solution Architect | Project Manager | Business Intelligence Strategist | Software Sorceress | Learn-it-all,"Old Orchard Beach, Maine, United States",https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFB3zLJoiQf6Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1535931775049?e=1625097600&v=beta&t=Dquf0qxWUfCKca4o1IglyO1CMYzcblynovSZ-1YM0L0,"Jodene ""Dene""",H.,"Jodene ""Dene"" H.",2330,-1,ACoAAAE4FoABi5uF2QX7tXMkhvcoTdgtpqqBR18,20452992,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAE4FoABi5uF2QX7tXMkhvcoTdgtpqqBR18,name",500,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAE4FoABi5uF2QX7tXMkhvcoTdgtpqqBR18%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAE4FoABi5uF2QX7tXMkhvcoTdgtpqqBR18%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,Microsoft,https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/,Senior Project Manager,"Microsoft via Murphy & Associates

https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherinejlowry/,,"I have 5+ years of experience managing, developing, and building teams and strategy in startups, corporate VC, and management consulting. From chief of staff to scrum master, I have donned a wide variety of operational hats. At Yewno, I deployed CRMs, ATS systems, product and business planning cycles, and drove sales, legal, and fundraising priorities. I worked on strategy and operations for a portfolio of 50+ startups at McKinsey New Ventures, and conducted 8+ consulting engagements spanning across retention, M&A, private equity, strategic partnerships, and procurement as a McKinsey consultant. Before that, I was building my own startups in retail and peer-to-peer lending.
 
I combine a thoughtful perspective and a bias to action to create lasting user-focused systems, processes, and companies. In the startup and tech world, I am most excited by product and product marketing, people, operations, and go-to-market business functions.

I would also love to be a part of the advancement of technology, from digital transformation to the advanced technology that will allow our species to become a multi-planetary species. I am insistent on learning more from my profession to outside topics that interest me.

On that note, I am driven to lead, plan, communicate and find success in anything I do. My passion for technology led me to major in Information Technology at DePaul University. Then, my passion for travel led me to spend a year abroad studying Business Administration at ECE-BBA INSEEC in Lyon, France and Linkï¿½ï¿½ping University in Linkï¿½ï¿½ping, Sweden. Between these experiences, my skills aligned quite well to Project Management. I caught fire managing technology-based projects, and haven't stopped since.

I want to drive continuous evolution, and I believe g force behind constant business growth and technological advancement is the presence of skilled and dedicated project managers. My skills include building and developing teams to reach maximum performance and dedication, leading projects through the project lifecycle in all accounts, and maintaining a strop relationships with clients and project stakeholders. Further skills include my positivity, optimism, and sense of humor; traits that I believe are vital to everyone's sanity throughout a project.

And therefore, for the time being, you can watch me being a part of it through project management.","Project Manager | Microsoft Consulting Services
