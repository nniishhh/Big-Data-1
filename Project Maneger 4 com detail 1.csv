Currently, I'm project manager and policy advisor at Facebook. I hold professional experience from Facebook, PBS, NBC and The Obama White House. A former journalist, my writing has also been published in USA Today and HuffPost.

An experienced project manager, here are three key career accomplishments: 

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Led two global project teams at Facebook that disabled 200,000 abusive accounts and created policies for 2.7 billion users. 
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Co-wrote Facebookï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s global operational policy for spam, impacting 20,000 content reviewers.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Collaborated with 30+ stakeholders while leading and executing on projects. This included product, civic, legal, operations, risk, engineering and data teams. 

My speciality is managing global projects and policy writing. 

In my frng, listening to political podcasts, volunteering for progressive candidates, playing board games, watching Grey's Anatomy and listening to Taylor Swift's lover album.

As a first-generation Asian American, I've seen the struggles my parents went through to give a better life to my sister, brother, and me. They raised me up to never be afraid of hard work and be laser-focused on my dreams and goals. Oh boy, do I have many. Some of them are  

1. Giving my parents the lifestyle they thought can't become a reality
2. Empowering others with the mindset and resources to achieve dreams 
3. Creating a global impact in causes I care about (Breast Cancer Research, Women in Tech, etc.)

I knew those can't be realized through just working a job my whole life, so I chose to build and scale businesses under the guidance of successful entrepreneurs on the side.

Looking forward to connecting with other like-minded individuals! Happy to see if I could be of help.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheyennelogan/,,"I am an award-winning, seasoned Project Manager/Producer with experience leading high-functioning, multi-disciplinary teams through complex projects. I have never encountered a project I could not manage. I am inspired by results and outcomes that exceed expectations; I pride myself on achieving the impossible. I enjoy partnering with teams to make ideas come to life. With deep experience across a wide range of industries, I have the prowess to contribute to the overarching visions and manage the tasks necessary to execute said vision. I am adept at working with various stakeholders across product, technology, marketing, sales, and legal. I possess the ability to think strategically and be flexible to accommodate urgency and business needs.

Outside of Work: 
When Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not managing projects, you can find me exploring local terrain and expanding my palate. I geek out over traveling to foreign countries and connecting with people from different backgrounds. I love all things creative and recently took upior design as a hobby. I spend too much time talking about the importance of self-care and good mental health. Meditation relaxes me and jazz music soothes my soul. Michelle Obama is my hero; she constantly inspires me to be better, do better, and always take the high road.

During my time at Google, I've had the great opportunity to work in our two core businesses: Search & Search Ads. Within these groups, I've been even more fortunate to lead projects that are top-level organizational priorities due to their impact and scale, providing unique opportunities to learn and grow in highly visible and cross-functional environments.

In Search Ads, I led the effort to optimize and evolve the user interface of Google Search on mobile. As the lead PM, I provided strategic direction to a team of 20+ engineers, designers, quantitative analysts, and researchers to brainstorm, experiment, and launch whole-page redesigns that improved the user experience of Search while also driving value to advertisers. These efforts drove multi-billion dollar impact to Google revenue and were launched toï¿½ï¿½all mobile users of Search, affecting hundreds of millions of people per day.ï¿½ï¿½

Today, I'm a product manager complete, the product that helps users complete their queries to Search across all platforms (mobile web, desktop, and the Google Search apps). Since this product sits at the very top of the funnel, improvements our team makes have the potential to significantly impact top-level Search metrics and usership, once again making this area a top-level strategic priority for Google.

The name is also claimed to be reminiscent of the Library of Alexandria.

Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant developed by Amazon, made popular by the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Echo Dot devices developed by Amazon Lab126. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audio books, and providing weather, traffic, and other real time information, such as news.
