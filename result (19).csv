I had many questions: How do they follow the other ants? Why do they walk in straight lines? How do they find food? My determined curiosity and laser focus led to hours of examination. I perceived patterns, intuited theories, and performed experiments to verify my ideas. And I have been wondering about the world ever since.

Currently, I am a data scientist providing analytic support for Minecraft at Microsoft.  Prior to being a data scientist, I researched Earth’s climate by analyzing simulations on the most powerful supercomputer in the world at the time - Titan at ORNL. I have 10 years of experience in computational science and scientific data analysis through research during my graduate school and postdoctoral work. My tenacious curiosity and technical skills make me an excellent data detective.

Besides my quantitative skills, I also love the challenge of communicating complicated ideas. I like to synthesize the story behind the data. I've presented 12 conference posters, given 8 technical lectures, and published 5 peer-reviewed articles.

I still wonder about the world.

Our findings provide business leadership with actionable insights to shape product strategy, investment, and direction, with the ultimate goal of giving our customers the best experience possible.

In my prior role as Chief Data Science Officer at Honeywell, I shaped the technology and business approach to data science, data management, and data engineering for the Connected Enterprises business and for the Corporation. In partnership with business and analytics leaders across the enterprise, we enabled and advanced IoT services and products that leverage data, analytics, and artificial intelligence, creating massive value for our customers. 

Before moving to Honeywell, I was Vice President of Data Science at Capital One, where I moved the needle around adoption of a data science culture, and accelerated advanced analytics and AI into the heavily regulated financial services environment.  Prior to Capital One, I was Vice President of Data Science Services at GE Digital where I developed the Company's data science talent model, culture and capability, established a new data science services business model spanning the GE verticals such as Healthcare, Aviation and Oil & Gas, and enabled Analytics as a Service (AaaS) via Predix, GE's big data and analytics software platform. 

As a classically trained electrical, biomedical, and systems engineer, I have leveraged my experience in startup and Fortune 100 environments to launch products and services into the market - from R&D to NPI, across hardware, software, biomedical and point-of-care systems, to digital pathology and financial services solutions requiring FDA, NRC, FAA, OCC and other regulatory approval and compliance.

From academia through present day, my career focus has been on enabling business and societal impact at scale - through products, services, and actionable insights from data.","Executive leading R&D, Data Science, Technology & New Product Development, and Customer Success across Healthcare, Industrials/IoT, Tech, and Fintech","Mountain View, California, United States",https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQGLr73ePeBM2Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1516250843097?e=1625097600&v=beta&t=xrcdcC3KQXDsPHSKwMy-tsqrKDeW46gLYxLBVRivKA0,Alexander,"Ross, Ph.D.","Alexander Ross, Ph.D.",2744,3rd,ACoAAAAbts4BkmqbpHR5OSBEDRAw4BK1FoE33nM,1816270,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAAbts4BkmqbpHR5OSBEDRAw4BK1FoE33nM,name",500,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAAbts4BkmqbpHR5OSBEDRAw4BK1FoE33nM%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAAbts4BkmqbpHR5OSBEDRAw4BK1FoE33nM%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,Google,https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/,"Director, Customer Experience Laboratory","Mountain View, California, United States",2020 – Present,Honeywell,https://www.linkedin.com/company/honeywell/,"Chief Data Science Officer and VP, Industrial Analytics","Atlanta, GA",2018 – 2019,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,https://www.linkedin.com/school/19005/?legacySchoolId=19005,"Ph.D., M.S.",,Biomedical Engineering,Binghamton University,https://www.linkedin.com/school/19027/?legacySchoolId=19027,B.S.,Electrical Engineering,"R&D, Medical Devices, Cross-functional Team Leadership, Project Management, Biomedical Engineering, Engineering, Six Sigma, Product Development, Signal Processing, Electronics, Medical Imaging, Strategy, Research and Development (R&D), Data Analysis, Data Science, Electrical Engineering, Big Data, Business Development, Business Process Improvement, Algorithms, Life Sciences, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Machine Learning, Change Management, Informatics, Design of Experiments (DOE), Research, Leadership, Management, Process Improvement, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Engineering, Big Data Analytics, Technology Change Management, Large Scale Change Management, Applied Machine Learning, Biomedical Devices, Biomedical Device Design, Biomedical Applications, Biomedical Informatics, Digital Transformation, Healthcare Analytics, Data Analytics, Bioengineering, Executive Leadership, Strategic Analytics",R&D,76,Medical Devices,48,Cross-functional Team Leadership,43,Project Management,38,Biomedical Engineering,36,Engineering,29,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandersross?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAAbts4BkmqbpHR5OSBEDRAw4BK1FoE33nM,alexandersross,2021-05-01T13:25:05.021Z,"As Chief Data Science Officer, I integrated and shaped the Company's global approach to data management, data governance, data engineering, and data science / analytics, leveraging my philosophy about value-creation and data risk management, rather than the common “collect big data” first approach.

Application of these frameworks spanned operational projects in sales, supply chain optimization and freight logistics through customer-facing projects such as aerospace manufacturing and warehouse management.

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP) Research. I explored evaluation metrics for text summarization with a focus on building a robust factual consistency metric. I also worked in the Multimodal Lab with a focus on active learning to improve sample efficiency of emotion recognition tasks. 

Before this, I was working as a data scientist in Goldman Sachs for three years where I worked to automate production management for the firm. My experience spans from building an ML system with time series algorithms that incorporate human feedback using ""human-in-the-loop"" techniques - to building big data pipelines leveraging Hadoop that enables such systems.

In the past, I have done projects in Non-linear dimensionality reduction and NLP with a focus on adding priors like domain knowledge or geometric intuitions to improve data-driven algorithms.

Our challenge is how to apply data science methods and analytics to truly understand the impact of our learning offerings for Microsoft employees, our customers, and our partners.  Thus far, here are some examples of what we've done.
- Employee skilling - we've built ways to use existing internal data sets to really measure the impact of our learning offerings on MS employees.  This has allowed us to understand both behaviorally where learners are demonstrating skills as well as ROI and business impact for key programs.
-  Manager/Coaching - we built a model leveraging calendar data to reflect manger ""intensity"" relative to time between a manager and their directs to see how our Coaching training created space and autonomy for our employees.
-  Certification planning - we've built a data-driven way to use in-market skills and job data to better understand the need and projections in considering new learning and certifications.
-  Feedback 360 - we've designed a way to integrate all of the different messages we get from our learners into an integrated an usable solution.  We'll be building this in the upcoming year and layering natural language on top of it to really reason across this disparate data.
-  Certification Journey analysis - we've built a model to represent the complete certification journey of any MS certified learner in the past 12 years.  This allows us to build correct paths for learners for new certifications as well as better author marketing and outreach content to get learners to the right destination.
-  Linkedin Analytics - we've partnered closely with our peer teams at LinkedIn to more formally exchange data to use in-market skills as the way to measure our learning business.

The first act, or the setup, is about exploring, defining, and developing a set of hypotheses to answer specific questions.

Prior to joining Google, I led Database services at AWS. One of my proudest accomplishments at AWS is the development and launch of Amazon Aurora, a massively scalable relational database service re-imagined for the cloud. Aurora has transformed the way people think about mission-critical databases in the cloud and has been the fastest growing service in the history of AWS. In 2019, I was named one of the technology executive of the year for transforming database industry. I also led the development and launch of AWS Glue, a data integration and transformation service at the core of AWS Datalake. 

Prior to joining AWS, I held multiple executive and technical leadership positions in IBM, including a 2-year international assignment in Shanghai, China. One of my key accomplishments in IBM is the development of Storwize, a family of virtualizing storage controller, and growing it to a $1B/year business in less than four years. Earlier in my career, I was a Principal Engineer at Tellium, an optical networking pioneer, that I helped grow from an early stage start-up to a public company ($3B+ IPO).

I am a Fellow of the IEEE and a Distinguished Member of the ACM. I have co-authored a book, 50+ US patent applications, 100+ technical articles including award winning papers and major Internet standards.

I engineered data solutions for big data processing of customer usage and estimated billing data sets.

I primarily worked on building multi-layered data warehouse architecture consisting of operational data store and presentation layers in Amazon Redshift. I worked with AWS products and services teams for building business metrics and in consuming data from DW platform for data driven decision making.

Collaborated with 51 AWS products and services at the time to migrate their analytics workload 
over 100,000 queries per week from Oracle based micro-cluster platform to Redshift based 
multi-cluster platform in a period of 18 months. 

Drove the roadmap for internal adoption of Redshift at AWS and co-built a self-service 
ETL tool for Redshift which currently serves over 300 Redshift cluster internally for 
decentralized data analytics and business reporting.

Optimized SQL data transformations for critical path reporting and improved the data delivery SLA
for AWS estimated billing revenue dataset by 33% (reduced from 3 hours to 2 hours) of processing
over 1 billion records per day.

Improved data quality of over 100 datasets in AWS DW through automated audits, 
source to target comparison, enforced integrity checks, reduced unnecessary workflow latency to
deliver data faster for downstream systems (reduced from 25% to 5%).

On-boarded over 50 new data sets from various AWS service teams to the enterprise Data Warehouse to meet reporting and new metrics need for customer analysis.

Defined strategy for data archival and implemented time series based archival mechanism to improve query latency and partition pruning based on sort keys.

Automated AWS Bill Run data ingestion workflow into the Enterprise Data Warehouse and ensured 100% SLA compliance.

I manage a team of Data Engineers, BI Engineers and Software Development Engineers who are building a next generation Data Platform to support the AWS business and operational data needs. Our data platform (Enterprise Data Lake and Data Warehouse) self-serves customer usage and revenue data for all teams (such as over 170 product & service owners, sales, marketing, business development, finance etc.) to gain business insights. 

My team’s mission is to help AWS be a more data driven business. The data engineering and analytics at AWS is the backbone for how we measure what we are doing, where we are going, find new opportunities to test things, or find fresh problems to solve. We help AWS teams to identify great metrics to define high impact projects and find drivers and components that make it succeed or fail. Finally, we arm decision makers with actionable information that can be as metrics, data tools or one of insights to decide whenever they need to. It is my great responsibility to ensure that I focus my engineering team on the very highest impact projects that move AWS forward and make a better suite of product for our customers.

As Mark explains on our 4Q20 earnings call: “If you look at the history of computing, every 15 years or so a new major platform emerges that integrates technology more naturally and ubiquitously into our lives -- starting with mainframes, then PCs, then browser-based computing, and then mobile. And I believe the next logical step is an immersive computing platform that delivers this magical sense of presence -- that you're really there with another person or in another place.” If you are a data scientist passionate about Oculus, Virtual Reality, and the next computing platform, message me to learn more!

Deep Learning Project (Image Authentication) 

Created a facial image authenticator to help social media users identify manipulated profile pictures. A modified transfer learning model (ResNet50) was used to train 100,000 color JPEG images which were preprocessed from mp4 videos to resized (640, 480, 3) color images using OpenCV. The output from the pre-trained model is passed into a dense layer with 10 neurons with ReLu activation function and finally passed into a dense layer of a single output neuron with a sigmoid function which outputs 1 (if manipulated) and 0 (if real). The current accuracy on the training and evaluation datasets is 55% and 52% respectively. This project is currently on hold until further collection of more data and AWS purchasing power for hyperparameter modeling tuning. 

2. Statistical and Machine Learning Projects
