My name is Danh Vuong and I am a full-stack web developer living in Seattle, WA. I have a broad experience with various development technologies, and I am currently specializing in JavaScript and React.
Coding and solving complex algorithm problems has been my passion since the day I started my Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly, Seattle. I love building web experiences that are effortless for users, and enjoy solving design problems through code.

Aside from coding, I am also a pianist and a conductor for my church choir. Having chance to work with various teams and people refined my empathy, strategy and problems solving. I translate those valuable skills to my work environment, which allows me to offer unique and creative approaches to any project or challenge.

Being allowed to independently think, decide, execute, and achieve is what excites me most. I enjoy success but at the same time have learned to pick myself up, dust myself off and persevere when a failure occurs. Having spent seven years playing cricket and captaining my team while in school, I went on to represent my university in squash. I learned the nuances of team dynamics and leadership in the sports field. I allow my creative juices to flow by experimenting with myriad cuisines and the process of creating a new dish gives me immense satisfaction. 

Experimenting with and using electronic equipment, sensors, microcontrollers, processors, robots, etc., is something that has always fascinated me. I also enjoy algorithmic programming using languages such as Python, C++, and Java.

I am extremely hardworking and committed to my goals. I enjoy challenges and am always on the lookout for any opportunity to LEARN!

This feature saved the team travel expenses and minimized long-distance travel, keeping the team as safe as possible while enabling productivity to continue.
2. Enabled the Launch Process Testing Team to work 100% remotely by building a tool-based testing solution to create Amazon's shipping labels from a home setup.

I haven't updated this in years, so take it with a grain of salt. ---

My career started when I was 12. I simultaneously started learning C++ and HTML, and this event foreshadowed the rest of my career up to this date: balancing the lowest-level and the highest-level code I can get my hands on. Without knowing any Computer Science theory, I wrote an interpreter for a minimalist C-like language using C when I was 14, and I was known as a ""JavaScript guru"" from age 15-17. 
At age 16, in 2006, I formed Cortex Creations. I worked with some great people and employed a great friend full-time, Joshua Diaz, for 2.5 years. This was a great period of learning for me, as it taught me that it takes more than just technical skill to produce a great product. 
In mid-2008, at the ripe age of 18, I had a mid-career existential crisis and decided to take a break from programming. I spent more time on music, picking up accordion and electronic music and spent more time practicing violin. I also discovered tea, biking, and started a comic series.
The break only lasted a year. By 2009 my interests had diversified. My relationship with Pearson Book Publishing began in 2009; since then I've reviewed several book proposals and reviewed technical accuracy of 2 books currently on the market. I worked on the web team for IceCube, the neutrino physics observatory, at the Madison headquarters during summer 2010. I toyed with Twitter and Safari Extensions, and was featured on Apple's Extension Gallery for a while.

Since 2011 I've been involved at 2 startups, one which was acquired by Yahoo, where I worked for two years. After that I switched gears and have been at a GPS hardware startup, Swift Navigation, since then.

Before Microsoft, I worked in Quant/Data science team at Morningstar. I primarily worked on building machine learning applications (Risk Models) from scratch using distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark, Python, HDFS, and AWS cloud services to estimate the returns and risks in an investors portfolio. My experience includes, optimized ETL production jobs and model build jobs by leveraging Spark in-built and vectorized UDF functions; This resulted in a massive reduction of execution time while running on AWS EMR cluster. Also, I was involved in architecting and building recommendation models to proactively suggest Morningstar data points that help users to screen funds, ETFs, Stocks etc., so clients can make informed decisions. In addition, I built AWS IAC tools to migration on-premise services to the AWS cloud using cloud formation and Terraform. Automated CICD pipelines using AWS services. Implemented highly scalable, reliable, and cost-effective architectural patterns using  AWS services. I am a certified AWS solutions architect Associate. 

 I graduated from Purdue School of science, Indianapolis majored in computer science. My Master's research includes Data Mining, Large Scale Machine Learning. My thesis was based on Graph Mining.  In my thesis, I proposed and implemented the enumeration of k-cliques in large-scale real-world graphs using distributed framework called Apache Spark. In addition, I also worked as a Research Assistant which involved building classification and regression models using python.

I also interned at Pinnacle Solutions Inc,  as a Data Scientist. My work at Pinnacle includes building and deploying predictive modeling techniques using different classification techniques like SVM, LR using PySpark and compared with SAS Eminer and AWS ML.

That's a brief of who I am and what I am looking for!

A bit deeper about myself:
I strive to be an Algorithm Engineer. This sprouted because I am mainly interested in how things work the way they work. For example: If you give me an algorithm and say that this works for a particular problem- my first question would be how does it work? What's the idea behind it? Why not some other way? What are the pros and cons of it? What was the approach that is worse than this? 
This thinking made to be successful as a programmer till now and enhanced my interest in Algorithms.

Besides, this interest in reasoning made me to develop curiosity in understanding how Machine Learning and Deep learning models actually work. What is the model learning at each step? I want to explore this Blackbox which I think would pave a way to make the Deep learning models better.

Apart from being a Computer Science Engineer, I have an immense interest in Neuroscience and would love to learn and talk about it. I am also a philanthropist who likes to participate in volunteer activities including teaching, taking care of homeless people, feeding animals and treating dogs.",https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHIOPeES71reQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1560108324060?e=1625702400&v=beta&t=_xJDr0pbIrStdAMbPTXAWHDziOCILVOR3HTrbbDC-zk,,"Worked on the performance data of Cloud Mobility Manager at Nokia to represent it in a useful format and perform Data Analysis using Machine Learning models for better overload control.

My tasks to start were, 
* Parsing large log files having different formats to a single pandas data frame.
* Developing a web application in Python using Flask and React.js to view the data and graphs related to them.
* Applying Machine Learning Models to understand correlation between different parameters and detect anomalies.

Our findings provide business leadership with actionable insights to shape product strategy, investment, and direction, with the ultimate goal of giving our customers the best experience possible.

In my prior role as Chief Data Science Officer at Honeywell, I shaped the technology and business approach to data science, data management, and data engineering for the Connected Enterprises business and for the Corporation. In partnership with business and analytics leaders across the enterprise, we enabled and advanced IoT services and products that leverage data, analytics, and artificial intelligence, creating massive value for our customers. 

Before moving to Honeywell, I was Vice President of Data Science at Capital One, where I moved the needle around adoption of a data science culture, and accelerated advanced analytics and AI into the heavily regulated financial services environment.  Prior to Capital One, I was Vice President of Data Science Services at GE Digital where I developed the Company's data science talent model, culture and capability, established a new data science services business model spanning the GE verticals such as Healthcare, Aviation and Oil & Gas, and enabled Analytics as a Service (AaaS) via Predix, GE's big data and analytics software platform. 

As a classically trained electrical, biomedical, and systems engineer, I have leveraged my experience in startup and Fortune 100 environments to launch products and services into the market - from R&D to NPI, across hardware, software, biomedical and point-of-care systems, to digital pathology and financial services solutions requiring FDA, NRC, FAA, OCC and other regulatory approval and compliance.

I evaluated how to best leverage and tune the ""fine-tuning"" process of BERT in order to use it as a transformer for downstream classification tasks. We employ a simple Bag of Words model as well as other DNN based architectures for comparisons from the perspective of both metrics (like accuracy) as well as efficiency (training time).
Areas of learning include Deep Neural Networks based Language Models, classical NLP, Parallel Processing via multiple GPUs, Pytorch based model implementation.

I have also successfully completed graduate courses like Statistical Machine Learning, Applied Statistics and Experimental Design, Introduction to Statistics and Probability, Information Visualization, and Database Management at UW with a cumulative GPA of 3.88. 

I've been a Research Assistant at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, where I worked on estimating the burden of disease averted by personal health care in the US, where burden is measured by disability-adjusted-life-years and personal health care by the healthcare quality and access index.

I previously worked in Algorithmic Trading at Goldman Sachs, for 5 years where I analyzed market data, in the form of time series data, to calibrate signals for trading algorithms and worked on numerous regression problems to determine the optimal tolerance bands for trading. I've played a multitude of roles, from quantitative research on volume profiles to being a lead developer for highly time sensitive trading algorithms in an event-driven programming language. I've led high profile projects with 10+ people, collaborating with tech, sales, researchers and clients.

I also worked in the Multimodal Lab with a focus on active learning to improve sample efficiency of emotion recognition tasks. 

Before this, I was working as a data scientist in Goldman Sachs for three years where I worked to automate production management for the firm. My experience spans from building an ML system with time series algorithms that incorporate human feedback using ""human-in-the-loop"" techniques - to building big data pipelines leveraging Hadoop that enables such systems.

In the past, I have done projects in Non-linear dimensionality reduction and NLP with a focus on adding priors like domain knowledge or geometric intuitions to improve data-driven algorithms.

- Employee skilling - we've built ways to use existing internal data sets to really measure the impact of our learning offerings on MS employees.  This has allowed us to understand both behaviorally where learners are demonstrating skills as well as ROI and business impact for key programs.
-  Manager/Coaching - we built a model leveraging calendar data to reflect manger ""intensity"" relative to time between a manager and their directs to see how our Coaching training created space and autonomy for our employees.
-  Certification planning - we've built a data-driven way to use in-market skills and job data to better understand the need and projections in considering new learning and certifications.
-  Feedback 360 - we've designed a way to integrate all of the different messages we get from our learners into an integrated an usable solution.  We'll be building this in the upcoming year and layering natural language on top of it to really reason across this disparate data.
-  Certification Journey analysis - we've built a model to represent the complete certification journey of any MS certified learner in the past 12 years.  This allows us to build correct paths for learners for new certifications as well as better author marketing and outreach content to get learners to the right destination.
-  Linkedin Analytics - we've partnered closely with our peer teams at LinkedIn to more formally exchange data to use in-market skills as the way to measure our learning business.

I engineered data solutions for big data processing of customer usage and estimated billing data sets.

I primarily worked on building multi-layered data warehouse architecture consisting of operational data store and presentation layers in Amazon Redshift. I worked with AWS products and services teams for building business metrics and in consuming data from DW platform for data driven decision making.

Collaborated with 51 AWS products and services at the time to migrate their analytics workload 
over 100,000 queries per week from Oracle based micro-cluster platform to Redshift based 
multi-cluster platform in a period of 18 months. 

Drove the roadmap for internal adoption of Redshift at AWS and co-built a self-service 
ETL tool for Redshift which currently serves over 300 Redshift cluster internally for 
decentralized data analytics and business reporting.

Optimized SQL data transformations for critical path reporting and improved the data delivery SLA
for AWS estimated billing revenue dataset by 33% (reduced from 3 hours to 2 hours) of processing
over 1 billion records per day.

Improved data quality of over 100 datasets in AWS DW through automated audits, 
source to target comparison, enforced integrity checks, reduced unnecessary workflow latency to
deliver data faster for downstream systems (reduced from 25% to 5%).

On-boarded over 50 new data sets from various AWS service teams to the enterprise Data Warehouse to meet reporting and new metrics need for customer analysis.

Defined strategy for data archival and implemented time series based archival mechanism to improve query latency and partition pruning based on sort keys.

Automated AWS Bill Run data ingestion workflow into the Enterprise Data Warehouse and ensured 100% SLA compliance.

The data engineering and analytics at AWS is the backbone for how we measure what we are doing, where we are going, find new opportunities to test things, or find fresh problems to solve. We help AWS teams to identify great metrics to define high impact projects and find drivers and components that make it succeed or fail. Finally, we arm decision m insights to decide whenever they need to. It is my great responsibility to ensure that I focus my engineering team on the very highest impact projects that move AWS forward and make a better suite of product for our customers.

Deep Learning Project (Image Authentication) 

Created a facial image authenticator to help social media users identify manipulated profile pictures. A modified transfer learning model (ResNet50) was used to train 100,000 color JPEG images which were preprocessed from mp4 videos to resized (640, 480, 3) color images using OpenCV. The output from the pre-trained model is passed into a dense layer with 10 neurons with ReLu activation function and finally passed into a dense layer of a single output neuron with a sigmoid function which outputs 1 (if manipulated) and 0 (if real). The current accuracy on the training and evaluation datasets is 55% and 52% respectively. This project is currently on hold until further collection of more data and AWS purchasing power for hyperparameter modeling tuning.

1) I've built data science solutions for two of the largest and ubiquitous insurance brands in the US. I've dug deep into the data to find answers to ambiguous questions and worked with stakeholders to turn those insights into product improvements. 

2) I love data science. But I love developing data scientists more. There's nothing more satisfyingly than watching those you've invested in grow and succeed. 

3) My first job was to collect carts for a big box retailer at age 16. In the very rainy northwest. That job convinced me that I absolutely HAD to go to college because I was not about that life.

4) I'm sort of obsessed with agile as it applies to data science. I helped to kick start adoption of agile in my role as a supervisor of an analytics team at GEICO and I've been applying it and learning lessons ever since. I think ultimately agile is about creating relationships of trust amongst everyone involved in a work stream, up, down, and sideways and pushing decisions to the people with the most information. When that's done right, you'll do some of the best work of your life.

1. Attackers are going to penetrate perimeter defenses. Yet, only the most mature security operations have visibility and understand their normal enterprise behavior, let alone those of an attacker.

2. Statistical methods are under-utilized for attack detection.  There is huge promise in identifying attack-consistent events that are also rare with respect to a historic, predictive model.  A good understanding of the underlying model assumptions, combined with security domain knowledge, is critical to the proper application of statistical or machine learning approaches.

3. Attacks do not happen in isolation on a single endpoint. Instead, they are exhibited across multiple endpoints, and in the communications between these endpoints. This leads to questions about local, connected subgraphs, within the larger network graph.

PLEASE do not send me resumes. All hiring, even internships is done through google.com/careers

PLEASE do not ask me for a referral if I don't know you personally, already

PLEASE do not connect with me to spam me to buy your product or service

PLEASE do not connect with me to spam for your random position that you're recruiting for. Get to know me first before you consider me a 'fit' for your open position. 99% of my job offers from spamming headhunters are as a junior developer. Not bragging, but I'm not exactly junior anymore! :)

Please realize that I'm super busy, and I cannot accept to speak at every event, interview at every podcast, give resume feedback for everyone etc. etc. If I can't do it, please don't be offended.

Please realize that I'm super busy, so if I'm helping you to debug a coding problem, I'll generally give guidance, but can't look deep into your code. And please don't get offended (like so many have) when I won't spend hours fixing your code for you...

My 8 years of working for and founding startups has required me to wear many hats. Through tackling tasks big and small I have acquired a diverse set of skills for a data scientist. My primary specialization is in developing novel mathematical models and leading technical teams in productizing their outputs. A strong mathematical foundation coupled with the ability to rapidly acquire and assimilate domain knowledge have allowed me to create new products, patents, and research in a wide range of fields, including:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Weather and Climate
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Photovoltaic Power Production
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Enterprise Gamification
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Social Collaboration
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Workforce Analytics
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Digital Assistants
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Professional Learning
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Cloud Computing 

My role as a thought leader in these fields has led to the granting of three patents, with six more pending applications. I have co-authored research papers, white papers, press releases, avering the ideas Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve worked on. Additionally, I have been an invited speaker at academic and industry conferences, and universities. My recent work at ManageLabs resulted in me being named a Dent 2019 Scholar. 

I recently joined Google Cloud working on Cloud Capacity and Efficiency projects.

However, data alone cannot make companies successful. As Carly Fiorina once said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Unlocking the latent value of data requires a penchant for problem-solving, with a mix of communication skills and technical rigor.

My passion for the field of analytics began at Mu Sigma Business Solutions, where I worked as a certified Decision Scientist. I worked with the supply chain team of a food manufacturing giant and recommended data-driven solutions for lean production.I also helped a Fortune 10 auto-manufacturing giant increase their profits by $6Million through data-driven price changes. Working with diverse industries has polished my ability to look at a problem from multiple perspectives.

As a sportsperson, I know the importance of motivation and communication for success. I have translated these values into my role as a team lead for various projects. I was also the main point of my clients. Through my experience, I have become adept at translating the language of data into actionable business decisions. My company has recognized my efforts in the form of two ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½spot awardsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ for excellence in delivery and team leadership.

Additionally, I continue to develop my technical skills as a graduate student in Information Systems Management. Through my coursework I am fine-tuning my ability to analyze data and appreciate the complexity of businesses. Upon completion, I will be equipped to solve the most demanding and pressing problems of the industry.

As the nature of business problems continues to become increasingly complex, analytics is a key driver for the success.I would love to contribute to the success of your company by leveraging my diverse experience with problem-solving, my leadership skills, and technical aptitude.
